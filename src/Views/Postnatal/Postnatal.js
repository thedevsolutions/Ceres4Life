                <p>
                  In the immediate weeks following childbirth women need extra
                  care, including partner and <br /> family support. Labour and
                  childbirth are physically demanding, as is breastfeeding and{" "}
                  <br />
                  looking after a newborn baby. It is therefore very important
                  that women regain their strength
                  <br /> and maintain their health as they adjust to life with
                  their new baby.
                  <br />
                  Women in the postnatal period need to maintain a balanced
                  diet, just as they did during
                  <br /> pregnancy. Iron and folic acid supplementation should
                  also continue for 3 months after birth.

                Talk to your health care provider if you want to delay having children until later in your life. It becomes < br/> more difficult for many women and men 35 years and over to achieve a pregnancy. Women 35 years and< br/> over may have a more difficult pregnancy and birth. They may also have greater risks of medical< br/> problems during pregnancy. The baby may also be born with health problems. The quality of a manâ€™s< br/> sperm also declines in his mid-thirties. His health problems may also increase. Even though there are< br/> fertility treatments available to assist with getting pregnant, such as in vitro fertilization, the success of< br/> treatment also declines with age.
                <br/>
                Women who are breastfeeding require additional food and
                  should drink sufficient clean
                  <br /> water. You should spend more time on nutrition
                  counselling with women who are very thin
                  <br /> and with adolescents who may need additional
                  information to help them get a balanced
                  <br /> diet. In some cases you may need to refer women to a
                  nutrition counsellor, where available. It
                  <br /> is important to note that poverty may prohibit women
                  from accessing certain foods. Exploring
                  <br /> less expensive options can be a helpful part of the
                  counselling session.
